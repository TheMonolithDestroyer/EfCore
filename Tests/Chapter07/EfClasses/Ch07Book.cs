           #C This returns a copy of the reviews that were loaded. By taking a copy it means no one can alter the list by casting the IEnumerable<T> to List<T>
           #D I add a method to allow a new Review to be added to the _reviews collection
           #E I add the new review to the backing field _reviews. This will update the database on the call to SaveChanges
           #F I then recalculate the average votes for the book
           #G I add a method to remove a review from the _reviews collection
